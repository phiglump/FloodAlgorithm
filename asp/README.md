This inspiration for this program came from the Hamiltonian path video. For the most part the coding was fairly simple and
straightforward. After watching the video I had everything that I needed to know to complete it. In order to run the program 
simply type the following command: clingo ./flood.lp test1.lp -c start=a . This will work for any starting node aswell just change
the a to the perfered starting node. flood.lp is the actual code itself that parses the graph to find the neighbors, test1.lp is a 
sample graph and it can be changed out for another sample so long as the syntax is the same.
